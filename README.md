# Question 2: How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?

**Answer:** Effective cost control prevents budget overruns and contributes to project success. Strategies include budget planning, resource allocation, change management, and regular reviews.

# Question 3: Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

**Answer:** 
* **Agile:** Flexible, adaptable, customer-focused, but less structured. Best for uncertain requirements and frequent changes (e.g., software startups).
* **Waterfall:** Structured, predictable, but less flexible and longer development cycles. Best for well-defined projects with fixed deadlines (e.g., large-scale infrastructure projects).

# Question 4 In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

**Answer:**
* **Agile:** Suitable for projects with uncertain requirements, frequent changes, and a focus on customer feedback (e.g., software startups, web applications).
* **Waterfall:** Suitable for projects with well-defined requirements, fixed deadlines, and minimal changes (e.g., large-scale infrastructure projects, critical systems).

# Question 5 What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?

**Answer:** Quality assurance methods include code reviews, unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing. High-quality software enhances user satisfaction, strengthens brand reputation, and reduces costs.

# Question 6 How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?

**Answer:** A well-defined project scope prevents scope creep and ensures focus. A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) breaks down the project into smaller, manageable tasks, aiding in resource allocation and progress tracking.

# Question 7 What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?

**Answer:** Detailed project schedules improve planning, risk identification, resource allocation, and progress tracking. Gantt charts visually represent tasks, durations, and dependencies, aiding in project management.

# Question 8 What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience? 

**Answer:** Smooth interface, timely update, adaptability and software responsiveness.

# Question 9 How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
